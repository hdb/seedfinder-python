# Getting Started

Simple Python wrapper for [seedfinder.eu](https://en.seedfinder.eu/)'s API.


## Install

`pip install seedfinder`


## API Access

You will need to [create an account](https://en.seedfinder.eu/register.html) at seedfinder.eu and [verify a domain or IP](https://en.seedfinder.eu/userarea/action/jsonapi.html) in order to access the API.

To authorize requests, you need to either make a request from a verfied address or initialize the SeedFinder object with your API token.


```{note} seedfinder.eu requires that you register an address *even if you are only accessing the API by token*.
```
